# Photo editing apps

## Tezza

- Tezza is a free photo editing app developed by Cole Hermann. It is available to download through the app store. It comes with in-app purchases and for 1.99 pm charged to an itunes account. There is an excellent and wide range of features and settings available to the user. The app comes with an easy to follow guide and offers a range of tutorials for both photo and video presets.

- Unfortuantely the app is only available in english. However, the clear and simple layout should make navigating the app easier for any non-english speaking users. A downfall of the app is that it does not allow you to connect to your social media so that you can directly post your edited photos. Tezza's range of special effects is a little underwhelming in terms of quantity. But, it does provide you with a few very good options which I enjoy to use frequently. I have not seen similar effects in any other photo editing app, therefore gaining the upperhand in terms of quality.

- The pros of the Tezza app outweigh the negatives in my opinion, especially due to my favourite feature which allows you to save your own customized presets and apply them to multiple pictures and videos. This feature is beneficial in keeping the aesthetic of your social media or brand consistent.

## PicsArt

- PicsArt is a photo editing app which is mainly graphic design focused. It offers an impressive range of special effects including photoshop. With over 1billion users PicsArt is avaible to download for free on the appstore and also comes with in-app features. For a more expensive price of 4.99 pm the app unlocks multiple advanced features such as geometric brushes, AI selection, drawing tools, background erasers, text inputs, and an increased variety of editing tools and filters.

- What is unique to PicsArt is that it has established its own publishing website where users can share their work on an independent platform. The app can be used in over 20 languages, increasing its reach and discoverability.

- To compliment its graphic design features there are over 1million free images available to the user. As well as including the option to upload your own photos and videos from your camera roll.

- PicsArt's wide range of features makes meme, tik tok, and reels users more inclined to use this app when creating content.

## Preview

- Preview is a unique app deigned to work hand in hand with the social media platform Instagram. Its purpose is to allow the user to link their Preview account with their Instagram. By linkning the Instagram acccount the profile is then mirrored onto the preview page. The app then allows the user to provisionally upload multiple photos and videos to the preview page. Users are then able to rearrange and shuffle posts on the feed through the drag and drop feature.

- The app comes with a scheduler and analystics feature which corresponds to the analystics of the users Instagram account. The purpose of these features is to allow the user to carefully design and organise their Instagram account following a particular aesthetic. The planner aspect is very beneficial for users aiming to increase their engagemnet and overall growth as regular and consistent posting has been proven to do this.

- Although Preview was developed to work alongside Instagram it is not a requirement of the user to have an Instagram account, meaning users are free to use the app solely for its editing tools and special effects features. Preview is avaiable for download on the appstore but is also available in desktop version.
